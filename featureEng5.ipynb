In practical terms, this means that there is no significant relationship between age and preference for a particular brand of soft drink based on the survey data provided.\n",

    "Summary:\n",
    "Using the provided survey data, we converted the categorical soft drink preferences into numerical ranks and ranked the ages. We then calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, which indicated the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between the variables. In this case, the relationship was very weak and negative, suggesting no meaningful correlation between age and soft drink preference in the sample."
